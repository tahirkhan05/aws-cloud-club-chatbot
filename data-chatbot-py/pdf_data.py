    The goal of AWS Cloud Club MJCET is to teach students about the AWS Cloud and its various use
    cases, including those related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Business Analytics, the
    Internet of Things, and Security. We will teach students about the benefits of the
    cloud and how it accelerates business.
    Furthermore, the AWS Cloud Club will give students hands-on experience through
    projects in the AWS Cloud, allowing students to develop both technical and business expertise in
    the cloud. This club will provide students with industry skills currently in high demand.

    Mission:
    AWS Cloud Clubs aims to provide a platform for students to learn about AWS technologies
    and cloud computing while fostering a community where they can network and collaborate
    with their peers. AWS Cloud Clubs are open to any learner aged 18+ and are regionally
    based, serving the needs of students locally.
    Cloud Club Captains are student leaders who partner with their local educational
    communities to launch these clubs. They are responsible for organizing events,
    promoting the club within their institution or community, and maintaining an active
    online presence for the club on platforms like Dev.to, LinkedIn, and Meetup.
    AWS Cloud Clubs offer a suite of benefits to Captains, including AWS exam vouchers,
    AWS credits, exclusive experiences in partnership with AWS employees, opportunities
    for speaking and workshops, special Cloud Club Captain swag, professional coaching,
    and more.

    Vision:
    The vision of AWS Cloud Clubs is to create a global network of student-led groups that promote
    learning, experimentation, and networking around AWS and cloud computing technologies. By
    providing students with access to exclusive learning opportunities and resources, AWS Cloud Clubs
    aim to help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the tech industry.

    Additionally, the clubs offer industry-relevant skills that are currently in high demand, helping students expand
    their career options, increase their technical social circles, and discover ways to engage with AWS as a technical 
    platform. They foster a global network of student-led groups that promote learning, experimentation, and networking

    Students gain access to exclusive learning opportunities and resources, including AWS credits, AWS exam vouchers,
